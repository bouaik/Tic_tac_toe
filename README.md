## Disclaimer

- There were several issues with the original project (non _v2 branches) so we had to make the game anew. The first version works, but didn't follow SOLID principles and was convoluted into mostly 1 method. This is why we needed to make a new version that follows the standards and makes RSpec easy and possible

## Built with

- Ruby

### Game Instructions

- Tic Tac Toe is a 2 player game, each player takes a turn and chooses a spot on the board where he places his mark (X/O). The winner is the player to have 3 marks in a straight line (vertical, horizontal or diagonal).

- To place your mark input a number from 1 to 9 which corresponds to the slots on the board. 
 
- Have fun!
